This template case was created to display a workflow
that combines different foam utilities and cfMesh to 
create an overset-case

=================

What to change to make this suitable for your own simulation

1. Changes in backgroundMesh
* adjust blockMeshDict
* adjust snappyHexMeshDict (refinementBoxes and levels only)

2. Changes in movingMesh
* insert your geometry
* (optional) run surfaceGenerateBoundaries to add a boundary case 
  if you simulate an external flow
* adjust the meshDict
* (optional) change for another mesher, e.g. snappyHexMesh
* adjust createCut.topoSet to modify the shape of the overset


===================

Problems:

Check that any timesteps are deleted before starting the meshing process
